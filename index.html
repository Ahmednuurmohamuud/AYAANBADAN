        <h1>Education</h1>
        <p> Education in Somalia has been severely impacted by decades of conflict and instability. As a result, the country has one of the lowest literacy rates in the world, with only 39% of adults able to read and write. Additionally, more than three million
            children are out of school. The Somali education system is divided into three levels: primary education (grades 1-8), secondary education (grades 9-12), and tertiary education (universities and colleges). Primary education is free and compulsory
            for all children, but attendance is not enforced. Secondary education is also free, but it is not compulsory. Tertiary education is not free, but it is subsidized by the government.</p>

            <h1> Experience</h1>
            <p>
                The education experience in Somalia can be challenging, but it is also rewarding. For many Somali children, going to school is a privilege that they cherish. One of the biggest challenges facing Somali students is the lack of resources. Many schools are
                overcrowded, and students often have to share textbooks and other materials. Teachers may not have adequate training, and there may be a lack of teaching materials. Another challenge is the security situation. In some areas of Somalia,
                it is dangerous for children to go to school. Schools have been attacked, and teachers and students have been killed or injured.
