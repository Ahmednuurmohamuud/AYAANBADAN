    <h1>Education</h1>
    <p> Education in Somalia has been severely impacted by decades of conflict and instability. As a result, the country has one of the lowest literacy rates in the world, with only 39% of adults able to read and write. Additionally, more than three million
        children are out of school. The Somali education system is divided into three levels: primary education (grades 1-8), secondary education (grades 9-12), and tertiary education (universities and colleges). Primary education is free and compulsory
        for all children, but attendance is not enforced. Secondary education is also free, but it is not compulsory. Tertiary education is not free, but it is subsidized by the government.</p>
