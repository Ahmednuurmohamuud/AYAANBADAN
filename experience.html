    <h1> Experience</h1>
    <p>
        The education experience in Somalia can be challenging, but it is also rewarding. For many Somali children, going to school is a privilege that they cherish. One of the biggest challenges facing Somali students is the lack of resources. Many schools are
        overcrowded, and students often have to share textbooks and other materials. Teachers may not have adequate training, and there may be a lack of teaching materials. Another challenge is the security situation. In some areas of Somalia, it is dangerous
        for children to go to school. Schools have been attacked, and teachers and students have been killed or injured.
